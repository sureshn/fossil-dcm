		<h2>The Concept</h2>
		<p style="font-size:16px">Fossil is a single-EXE, cross-platform, distributed source control management program written by SQLite author <br><strong>Dr. Richard Hipp.</strong> Unsurprisingly, data is saved in an SQLite database file, making it very easy to back up.
A project resides in one or more repositories. Each change ("commit", a.k.a. check-in) is identified by an "artifact ID", which can refer either to a specific change made to a specific file, or to the whole commit.
"At its lowest level, a Fossil repository consists of an unordered set of immutable "artifacts". You might think of these artifacts as "files", since in many cases the artifacts exactly correspond to source code files that are stored in the Fossil repository. But other "control artifacts" are also included in the mix. These control artifacts define the relationships between artifacts - which files go together to form a particular version of the project, who checked in that version and when, what was the check-in comment, what wiki pages are included with the project, what are the edit histories of each wiki page, what bug reports or tickets are included, who contributed to the evolution of each ticket, and so forth, and so on."

		<h2>Main commands for local use</h2>
		<p class="double" style="font-size:12px"><b>add:</b> Adds new files to the next commit; must run "commit" afterwards for this file to actually be added to the repository
<br><b>changes:</b> Shows changes made to files in the work directory; if no output, it means that no checked out files have been modified yet<br>
<b>close:</b> Closes the connection to the repo, ie. the _FOSSIL_ file in the work directory<br>
<b>commit:</b> Saves all changes to the repository, eg. add/remove files, add changes, etc.
<br><b>extras: </b>Lists files in the work directory and below that Fossil doesn't track, because they haven't been added and commited to the repo
<br><b>info:</b> Provides information about the current tree (if no argument given) or a particular object (otherwise). See "changes" and "status"
<br><b>finfo: </b>Infos on a specific file
<br><b>info:</b> Infos about the repo
<br><b>ls:</b> Lists files that Fossil tracks
<br><b>new:</b> Creates a new repo
       <br><b>open:</b>  Opens the connection to the repo, creating a _FOSSIL_ file in the current work directory
<br><b>mv:</b> Same as "rename"
            <br><b>revert:</b> Forgets changes to one or all files that haven't been commited yet
            <br><b>rm:</b> Same as "delete". Deletes files from the repository (but not from the work directory). From now on, the file(s) will no longer be part of the repository, altough all versions until then are still available
            <br><b>search:</b> Searches for any comment that matches the pattern
            <br><b>status:</b> Same as "changes", but with additional infos about changes made to checked-out files, if any, ie. status = info + changes
            <br><b>tag: </b>Add a tag to a revision. Can be used either when commiting changes or later
            <br><b>undo:</b> Cancels "revert"</p>
